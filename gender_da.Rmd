For more data, see <https://stats.oecd.org/>

The data:
- Enrollment in STEM grad programs, broken down by gender, field, level of education
- PISA science scores  
- PISA math scores  
- Graduation broken down by degree, field, gender (2017)  
- Earnings broken down by degree, gender, age (values are percentages, 100 refers to the average earnings of all people who completed secondary school)  
- Earnings broken down by numeracy level, gender (all ages 25-64, data from 2012 and 2015)

Enrollment data comes from <https://stats.oecd.org/> table called "Enrolment by field"

# Enrollment in grad programs

### Clean data
```{r}
# Clean data

# create reference table for flags
# I don't really know what these mean
tbl.flags <- as.data.frame(unique(enroll$Flag.Codes)) %>% bind_cols(as.data.frame(unique(enroll$Flags)))


# SEX and Sex columns are identical, remove Sex
# remove other redundant, useless variables
enroll.clean <- enroll %>% select(-c(Sex, COUNTRY, FIELD, COUNTRY_ORIGIN, Country.of.origin, ISC11_LEVEL, ISC11P_CAT, Category.of.education, YEAR, Unit.Code, Unit, PowerCode.Code, PowerCode, Reference.Period.Code, Reference.Period))
```

### EDA

- Each case represents enrollment in each country at a specific year, STEM field, and program level.

```{r}
enroll.clean$Country %>% nlevels
enroll.clean$Year %>% table
enroll.clean$Level.of.education %>% levels
```

- We have 40 countries observed over 5 years
- 3 levels of education plus total (Bachelor, Master, Doctoral, and Total Grad)
